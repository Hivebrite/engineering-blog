## Introduction

Hivebrite is a global SaaS platform that helps organizations build and grow their online communities. Our platform makes it easy for members to connect, engage, and collaborate across various sectors, universities, non-profits and businesses. At the heart of Hivebrite's success is our talented engineering team of arround 80 people who build and improve our platform every day. This blog is their space, a place to share their experiences, the technical challenges they tackle, the cutting-edge solutions they develop and the exciting projects that drive Hivebrite forward.

## Bootstrapping the engineering blog

Hivebrite has been running a [blog](https://blog.hivebrite.com/) since 2016, primarily focusing on our platform features, community management, and customer success stories. Our engineers have long wanted a space to share their work but never had the right place or time to do so. With a completely different editorial direction in mind, we decided to create a separate blog for engineering topics.
Welcome to [engineering.hivebrite.io](http://engineering.hivebrite.io)!

Building on the momentum of our latest hackathon, Hivehack'24, a small team of engineers finally brought this project to life! To move fast, we embraced an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach, taking a few shortcuts to get the blog up and running quickly. Everyone is busy and doesn't necessarily have time to implement all their great ideas in the blog's first version. We kept things simple by using [Go Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) to generate a static website, the '0xHivebrite' theme was adapted from an engineer's personal blog with a brutalist re-design. For hosting, [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) was the obvious choice to keep things simple.

Of course, this is just the beginning. Our frontend team is already excited to give the blog the great design it truly deserves!

## Objectives and editorial line

This blog aims to be a space where Hivebrite engineers can share their technical knowledge and accomplishments. As we target a technical audience, we will mostly focus on content that reflects our daily work: case studies, system design, engineering work and best practices. To encourage everyone to contribute, we welcome articles from all our teams, whether it's back-end, front-end, mobile, developer efficiency or site reliability engineering. While we haven't set specific posting frequency goals, we're committed to share quality content on a regular basis.

This blog also reflects how weâ€™re evolving as a remote friendly and distributed team. We are now putting more emphasis on clear written communication through documentation, asynchronous discussions and internal RFCs (Requests For Comments). More than just an internal initiative, we hope this space inspires our engineers to share their expertise beyond Hivebrite, contributing valuable insights to the wider tech community.

## Final words

We are thrilled to start sharing what Hivebrite engineers are working on!
Stay tuned, exciting content is coming soon!
